jjj_arduino - Arduino / Sinatra App
===================================

An Arduino project that was used on Australia day for Triple J's hottest 100 countdown. The application uses a sinatra app to talk to an arduino over a serial port.

Keep in mind this was a hacked together project the morning of Australia day :)

Installation
===================================
You will be required to install the ruby-serialport gem manually (I had issues with using it in the gemfile)

You can find the Arduino sketch in the root directory in a file called 'arduino_sketch.ino'
